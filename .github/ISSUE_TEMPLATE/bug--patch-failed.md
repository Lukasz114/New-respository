The following two information are what I need to fix the problem

1. Your kernel image. boot.img is too big, you can use 'magiskboot unpack boot.img' to get kernel image (which named 'kernel' after unpack)

2.  The real symbol informations corresponding to your boot.img or kernel
It can be obtained through the following two commands under **root**.
```shell
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
cat /proc/kallsyms
```
